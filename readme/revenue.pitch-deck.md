## Break Even Point / How do I get my money?
  
  * Debt: 10% interest rate, 5 year timeframe, zero equity.
  * Convertible Debt: 6% interest rate, 5 year timeframe, equity at current valuation.
  * Equity: Zero dividend or interest payments, X% equity.

Rough Notes:

  * Equation: x% of profit is warehoused for principle repayment.
  * Option 1: Focus on repayment of 150% principle, then a dividend based on equity until liquidation.
  * Option 2: Focus on preferred return and share of the liquidation event.
